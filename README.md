# AngularJS_MVVM
AngularJS example using MVVM pattern


In this sample, a simple illustration on how to pull data from a nested object or collection using AngularJS and the MVVM pattern. The ArtistClient.js view model contains the angular controller and factory for basic CRUD functionality. For example, the function getArtists() returns a json list of artists from the database through the MVC controller (ArtistController.cs) and displays it within the view (Index.cshtml).
